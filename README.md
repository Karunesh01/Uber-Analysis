# Uber-Analysis

This analysis examined one month of Uber operational data to uncover patterns in ride demand, revenue generation, and driver performance. 
The dataset included trip date, time, pickup and drop-off locations, trip duration, and fare details.
Results showed that evenings (5â€“8 PM) experienced the highest demand, reflecting commuter travel.
Weekends had peak activity in late evenings, likely driven by leisure trips. 
Revenue analysis revealed that peak-period trips generated higher average fares due to surge pricing, although short-distance rides made up most of the volume. 
These findings can guide driver allocation, incentive programs, and targeted promotions.
Visualizations such as Donut cahrts, bar charts and trend charts helped clearly present temporal and geographic demand patterns. 
Overall, the analysis provided actionable insights for optimizing operations, improving driver efficiency, and enhancing customer experience.
